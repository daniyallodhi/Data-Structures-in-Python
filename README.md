# Data-Structures-in-Python
As a Python programmer, it is essential to have a good understanding of data structures as they are the building blocks of algorithms and programs. Here are some of the data structures I have learned and practiced in Python:
<ol>
<li><b>Lists: </b>Lists are used to store a collection of items in Python. They are mutable, which means their values can be changed after creation.</li>
<li><b>Tuples: </b>Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, which means their values cannot be changed after creation.</li>
<li><b>Sets:</b> Sets are used to store unique elements in Python. They do not allow duplicates, and their values are unordered.</li>
<li><b>Dictionaries: </b>Dictionaries are used to store key-value pairs in Python. They are mutable, and the keys are unique.</li>
</ol>
By practicing these data structures, I have gained a better understanding of how to implement and use them in various programming scenarios.
